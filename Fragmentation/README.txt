The goal is to establish a phenomenological analatic function which gives 
double differential cross section d^2\sigma/ dP d\Omega of projectile fragmentation 
at low energy ~ 10 A MeV. 
For example, 40Ar projectile on 9Be target to produce 30Mg fragment at 15A MeV. 
Notami paper and Tarasov paper are fitted around 90A MeV .  

How to get the relevant data and make a fitting formula??
