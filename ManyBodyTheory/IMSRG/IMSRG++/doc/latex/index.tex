The in-\/medium similarity renormalization group (I\+M-\/\+S\+RG) is an ab initio method for solving many-\/body quantum systems. It has been thus far predominantly used in nuclear physics. For a review, see H. Hergert et al, Physics Reports 216, 165 (2016) doi\+: 10.\+1016/j.phys rep.\+2015.\+12.\+007, and references therein.

The main idea behind the I\+M-\/\+S\+RG is to obtain a unitary transformation $ U $ which transforms the Hamiltonian into a form which makes it easier to solve. This can either be by decoupling a single reference state from all other states, or by decoupling a valence space and diagonalizing within that space. We may parameterize the unitary transformation as the exponential of an anti-\/hermitian generator $ \Omega $ so that the transformed Hamiltonian is \[ H' = UHU^{\dagger} = e^{\Omega}He^{-\Omega} \]

This code contains a number of classes which may be used in the various specific schemes for implementing the above transformation. A subset of these classes are exposed as python classes, enabling rapid development of implementation schemes. The code and its documentation are very much a work in progress, so if you have any questions, or if you discover any bugs, please contact Ragnar Stroberg at sstroberg $<$at$>$ triumf.\+ca.
